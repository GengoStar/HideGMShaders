# HideGMShaders

GameMaker: Studio 2 leaves the shader code in your win files as-is (with comments) even though it converted them to HLSL11 binary code and doesnt have to store code anymore.  
What Im saying that any kid with a hex editor (or undertalemodtool) can steal your shaders even if you used YYC.  
My program fixes that (before and after):

If it said "we did it", your shaders had been hid and you can check with hex editor 

Doesnt work with GMS1 btw
